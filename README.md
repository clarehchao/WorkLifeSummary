# Work and Life Summary of Shih-ying (Clare) Chao
- Grew up in Taipei, Taiwan
- Moved to the U.S. in Sophomore year of high school in San Diego, CA
- I really enjoyed Calculus and computer programming classes in high school
- Finished my bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering (University of California, San Diego) with emphasis of image processing
- Completed my PhD in Biomedical Engineering (University of California, Davis) with Dr. John M. Boone (pioneer of the BreastCT imaging system)
- Research Scientist with the nuclear medicine group at UCSF (P.I: Youngho Seo, PhD)

## During my PhD years, I learned a lot ...
My lab was involved with several clinical trials, collecting breast CT images from hundreds of human volunteers
1. With the large amount of breast CT images, I characterized the beast anatomny in many ways including
  - Breast density
  - Cup-size related measurement
  - Skin thickness
  - Distribution of breast glandular tissues
  - More details in [skin thickness paper], [50/50 breast metrics], and [link to chapter 2 of dissertation]
  - **IMPACT**: The breast anatomy characterization helps the breast cancer research immensely by providing a gold standard of breast anatomy in many area of research including image simulation (when designing an imaging system or lack the amount of human imaging data for furthre research), dosimetry estimation and calculation, and image system optimization and designing
2. I optimized a new imaging technique (dual-energy mammography) on the BreastCT system
  - Simulated images by modeling the imaging detector and system setup (mathematically and experimentally characterized the detector of the BreastCT system)
  - Designed and constructed a static and dynamic breast phantom for optimization tasks
  - Conducted a comprehensive optimization considering various imaging system setup and the associated dosimetry
  - [link to chap 3 and 4 of disseration?]
  - **IMPACT**: determined the optimial imaging system setting of dual energy dynamic imaging using the BreastCT systme with imaging dose consideration
